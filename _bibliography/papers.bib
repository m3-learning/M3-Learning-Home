                   devices is desirable to mitigate plasma instabilities and
                   enable robust operation. Optical high-speed cameras provide
                   a powerful, non-invasive diagnostic and can be suitable for
                   these applications. In this study, we process fast camera
                   data, at rates exceeding 100kfps, on $\textit\{in situ\}$
                   Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware to track
                   magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) mode evolution and generate
                   control signals in real-time. Our system utilizes a
                   convolutional neural network (CNN) model which predicts the
                   $n$=1 MHD mode amplitude and phase using camera images with
                   better accuracy than other tested non-deep-learning-based
                   methods. By implementing this model directly within the
                   standard FPGA readout hardware of the high-speed camera
                   diagnostic, our mode tracking system achieves a total
                   trigger-to-output latency of 17.6$\mu$s and a throughput of
                   up to 120kfps. This study at the High Beta Tokamak-Extended

                data analysis in (scanning) transmission electron microscopy,

                transition to real-time analysis and closed-loop microscope

  title      = {Extremely Noisy {4D-TEM} Strain Mapping Using Cycle Consistent
                Spatial Transforming Autoencoders},
  author     = {Qin, Shuyu and Tran, Nhan and Agar, Joshua C},
  abstract   = {Atomic-scale imaging of 2D and quantum materials benefits from
                precisely extracting crystallographic strain, shear, and rotation
                to understand their mechanical, optical and electronic
                properties. One powerful technique is 4D-TEM (4-dimensional
                transmission electron microscopy), where a convergent electron
                beam is scanned across a sample while measuring the resulting
                diffraction pattern with a direct electron detector. Extracting
                the crystallographic strain, shear, and rotation from this data
                relies either on cross-correlation of probe templates (e.g.,
                implemented in py4DSTEM) or determining the center of mass (CoM)
                of the diffraction peaks. These algorithms have limitations. They
                require manual preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning, are
                sensitive to signal-to-noise, and generally are difficult to
                automate. There is no one-size-fits-all algorithm. Recently,
                machine learning techniques have been used to assist in analyzing
                4D-TEM data, however, these models do not possess the capacity to
                learn the strain, rotation, or translation instead they just
                learn an approximation that almost aways tends to be correct as
                long as the test examples are within the training dataset
                distribution. We developed a novel neural network structure --
                Cycle Consistent Spatial Transforming Autoencoder (CC-ST-AE).
                This model takes a set of diffraction images and trains a sparse
                autoencoder to classify an observed diffraction pattern to a
                dictionary of learned ``averaged'' diffraction patterns.
                Secondly, it learns the affine transformation matrix parameters
                that minimizes the reconstruction error between the dictionary
                and the input diffraction pattern. Since the affine
                transformation includes translation, strain, shear, and rotation,
                we can parsimoniously learn the strain tensor. To ensure the
                model is physics conforming, we train the model cycle
                consistently, by ensuring the inverse affine transformation from
                the dictionary results in the original diffraction pattern. We
                validated this model on a number of benchmark tasks including: A
                Simulated 4D TEM data of $WS_2$ and $WSe_2$ lateral
                heterostructures (noise free) with a ground truth of the strain,
                rotation and shear parameters. Secondly, we test this model on
                experimental 4D TEM on 2D heterostructures of tungsten disulfide
                ($WS_2$) and tungsten diselenide ($WSe_2$). This model shows
                several significant improvements including: 1. When tested on
                simulated data, the model can recover the ground truth with
                minimal error. 2. The model can learn the rotation and strain on
                noisy diffraction patterns where CoM failed, and significantly
                outperforms template matching (py4DSTEM). 3. Our model can
                accommodate large and continuous rotations difficult to obtain
                with other methods. 4. Our model is more robust to noisy data. 5.
                Our model can map the strain, shear and rotation; identify
                dislocation and ripples; and distinguish background and sample
                area automatically. Ultimately, this work demonstrates how
                embedding physical concepts into unsupervised neural networks can
                simplify, automate, and accelerate analysis pipelines while
                simultaneously leveraging stochastic averaging that improves
                robustness on noisy data. This algorithmic concept can be
                extended to include other physical phenomena (e.g., polarization,
                sample tilt), can be used in automated experiments, and can be
                applied to other applications in materials characterization.

                serve the purpose, equipping computational methods with physical
                rules is necessary. Integrating deep learning models with
                symmetry awareness has emerged as a promising approach to
                significantly improve symmetry detection in experimental data,
                with techniques such as parameter sharing and novel convolutional
                layers enhancing symmetry recognition.[1,2,3,4,5,6] However, the
                challenge of integrating physical principles, such as symmetry,

                benchmarking datasets and training frameworks, exploring three

                Our study demonstrates the limitations of deep learning models in

                 transformations using deep autoencoders, providing a pathway
                 towards real-time analysis is also established. These results
                 show a clear difference in the temperature at which phase
                 transition occurs and the domain behavior between various
                 environments, with a peculiar domain reconfiguration at low
                 temperatures, from a-c to a-a at $\approx$60 °C. The vacuum
                 environment exhibits a rich domain structure, while under the
                 oxidizing environment, the domain structure is largely
                 suppressed. The direct visualization provided by in situ gas
                 and heating STEM allows to investigate the influence of
                 external variables such as gas, pressure, and temperature, on
                 oxide surfaces in a dynamic manner, providing invaluable
                 insights into the intricate surface-screening mechanisms in
                 ferroelectrics.},
