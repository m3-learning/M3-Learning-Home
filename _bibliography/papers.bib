                   devices is desirable to mitigate plasma instabilities and
                   enable robust operation. Optical high-speed cameras provide
                   a powerful, non-invasive diagnostic and can be suitable for
                   these applications. In this study, we process fast camera
                   data, at rates exceeding 100kfps, on $\textit\{in situ\}$
                   Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware to track
                   magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) mode evolution and generate
                   control signals in real-time. Our system utilizes a
                   convolutional neural network (CNN) model which predicts the
                   $n$=1 MHD mode amplitude and phase using camera images with
                   better accuracy than other tested non-deep-learning-based
                   methods. By implementing this model directly within the
                   standard FPGA readout hardware of the high-speed camera
                   diagnostic, our mode tracking system achieves a total
                   trigger-to-output latency of 17.6$\mu$s and a throughput of
                   up to 120kfps. This study at the High Beta Tokamak-Extended
                   Pulse (HBT-EP) experiment demonstrates an FPGA-based
                   high-speed camera data acquisition and processing system,
                   enabling application in real-time machine-learning-based
                   tokamak diagnostic and control as well as potential
                   applications in other scientific domains.},

                 experimental data processing loop to accelerate scientific
                 discovery. The material for the report builds on two workshops
                 held by the Fast ML for Science community and covers three main
                 areas: applications for fast ML across a number of scientific
                 domains; techniques for training and implementing performant and
                 resource-efficient ML algorithms; and computing architectures,
                 platforms, and technologies for deploying these algorithms. We
                 also present overlapping challenges across the multiple
                 scientific domains where common solutions can be found. This
                 community report is intended to give plenty of examples and
                 inspiration for scientific discovery through integrated and
                 accelerated ML solutions. This is followed by a high-level
                 overview and organization of technical advances, including an
                 abundance of pointers to source material, which can enable these

                data analysis in (scanning) transmission electron microscopy,
                (S)TEM, imaging and spectroscopy. An emerging trend is the
                transition to real-time analysis and closed-loop microscope
                operation. The effective use of ML in electron microscopy now
                requires the development of strategies for microscopy-centric
                experiment workflow design and optimization. Here, we discuss
                the associated challenges with the transition to active ML,
                including sequential data analysis and out-of-distribution drift
                effects, the requirements for edge operation, local and cloud
                data storage, and theory in the loop operations. Specifically,
                we discuss the relative contributions of human scientists and ML
                agents in the ideation, orchestration, and execution of
                experimental workflows, as well as the need to develop universal
                hyper languages that can apply across multiple platforms. These
                considerations will collectively inform the operationalization
                of ML in next-generation experimentation.},

  abstract   = {In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
