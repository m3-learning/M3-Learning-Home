              through costly co-simulation cycles and through invasive tools and 
              interfaces. We propose a methodology where dynamic monitoring is embedded
              into the high level synthesis description of machine learning (ML) 
              accelerators within the open source hls4ml tool. We discuss the usage of
              the framework for monitoring FIFO channel utilization, which is a 
              critical structure utilized to implement streaming based ML
              accelerators on FPGAs."

  abstract      = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are broadly used
               in many engineering and physics fields. CFD requires the solution
               of the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations under complex flow and
               boundary conditions. However, applications of CFD simulations are
               computationally limited by the availability, speed, and
               parallelism of high-performance computing. To address this,
               machine learning techniques have been employed to create
               data-driven approximations for CFD to accelerate computational
               efficiency. Unfortunately, these methods predominantly depend on
               large labeled CFD datasets, which are costly to procure at the
               scale required for robust model development. In response, we
               introduce a weakly supervised approach that, through a
               multichannel input capturing boundary and geometric conditions,
               solves steady-state N-S equations. Our method achieves
               state-of-the-art results without relying on labeled simulation
               data, instead using a custom data-driven and physics-informed
               loss function and small-scale solutions to prime the model for
               solving the N-S equations. By training stacked models, we enhance
               resolution and predictability, yielding high-quality numerical
               solutions to N-S equations without hefty computational demands.
               Remarkably, our model, being highly adaptable, produces solutions
               on a 512 x 512 domain in a swift 7 ms, outpacing traditional CFD
               solvers by a factor of 1,000. This paves the way for real-time
               predictions on consumer hardware and Internet of Things devices,
               thereby boosting the scope, speed, and cost-efficiency of solving
               boundary-value fluid problems.},

                Spatial Transforming Autoencoders},
  author     = {Qin, Shuyu and Tran, Nhan and Agar, Joshua C},
  abstract   = {Atomic-scale imaging of 2D and quantum materials benefits from
                precisely extracting crystallographic strain, shear, and rotation
                to understand their mechanical, optical and electronic
                properties. One powerful technique is 4D-TEM (4-dimensional
                transmission electron microscopy), where a convergent electron
                beam is scanned across a sample while measuring the resulting
                diffraction pattern with a direct electron detector. Extracting
                the crystallographic strain, shear, and rotation from this data
                relies either on cross-correlation of probe templates (e.g.,
                implemented in py4DSTEM) or determining the center of mass (CoM)
                of the diffraction peaks. These algorithms have limitations. They
                require manual preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning, are
                sensitive to signal-to-noise, and generally are difficult to
                automate. There is no one-size-fits-all algorithm. Recently,
                machine learning techniques have been used to assist in analyzing
                4D-TEM data, however, these models do not possess the capacity to
                learn the strain, rotation, or translation instead they just
                learn an approximation that almost aways tends to be correct as
                long as the test examples are within the training dataset
                distribution. We developed a novel neural network structure --
                Cycle Consistent Spatial Transforming Autoencoder (CC-ST-AE).
                This model takes a set of diffraction images and trains a sparse
                autoencoder to classify an observed diffraction pattern to a
                dictionary of learned ``averaged'' diffraction patterns.
                Secondly, it learns the affine transformation matrix parameters
                that minimizes the reconstruction error between the dictionary
                and the input diffraction pattern. Since the affine
                transformation includes translation, strain, shear, and rotation,
                we can parsimoniously learn the strain tensor. To ensure the
                model is physics conforming, we train the model cycle
                consistently, by ensuring the inverse affine transformation from
                the dictionary results in the original diffraction pattern. We
                validated this model on a number of benchmark tasks including: A
                Simulated 4D TEM data of $WS_2$ and $WSe_2$ lateral
                heterostructures (noise free) with a ground truth of the strain,
                rotation and shear parameters. Secondly, we test this model on
                experimental 4D TEM on 2D heterostructures of tungsten disulfide
                ($WS_2$) and tungsten diselenide ($WSe_2$). This model shows
                several significant improvements including: 1. When tested on
                simulated data, the model can recover the ground truth with
                minimal error. 2. The model can learn the rotation and strain on
                noisy diffraction patterns where CoM failed, and significantly
                outperforms template matching (py4DSTEM). 3. Our model can
                accommodate large and continuous rotations difficult to obtain
                with other methods. 4. Our model is more robust to noisy data. 5.
                Our model can map the strain, shear and rotation; identify
                dislocation and ripples; and distinguish background and sample
                area automatically. Ultimately, this work demonstrates how
                embedding physical concepts into unsupervised neural networks can
                simplify, automate, and accelerate analysis pipelines while
                simultaneously leveraging stochastic averaging that improves
                robustness on noisy data. This algorithmic concept can be
                extended to include other physical phenomena (e.g., polarization,
                sample tilt), can be used in automated experiments, and can be
                applied to other applications in materials characterization.

  author     = {Guo, Yichen and Qin, Shuyu and Agar, Joshua},
  abstract   = {Utilizing computational methods to extract actional information
                from scientific data is essential due to the time-consuming and
                inaccurate nature of the manual processes of humans. To better
                serve the purpose, equipping computational methods with physical
                rules is necessary. Integrating deep learning models with
                symmetry awareness has emerged as a promising approach to
                significantly improve symmetry detection in experimental data,
                with techniques such as parameter sharing and novel convolutional
                layers enhancing symmetry recognition.[1,2,3,4,5,6] However, the
                challenge of integrating physical principles, such as symmetry,
                into these models persists. To address this, we have developed
                benchmarking datasets and training frameworks, exploring three
                perspectives to classify wallpaper group symmetries effectively.
                Our study demonstrates the limitations of deep learning models in
                understanding symmetry, as evidenced by benchmark results. A
                detailed analysis is provided with a hierarchical dataset and
                training outcomes, while a symmetry filter is designed aiming to
                improve symmetry operation recognition. This endeavor aims to
                push the boundaries of deep learning models in comprehending
                symmetry and embed physical rules within them, ultimately
                unlocking new possibilities at the intersection of machine
                learning and physical symmetry, with valuable applications in

  abstract    = {Ferroelectrics, due to their polar nature and reversible

                 chemistry for catalysis, chemical switching, and other
                 applications such as water splitting. However, this is a
                 complex phenomenon where ferroelectric domain orientation and
                 switching are intimately linked to surface charges. In this
                 work, the temperature-induced domain behavior of
                 ferroelectric-ferroelastic domains in free-standing BaTiO3
                 films under different gas environments, including vacuum and
                 oxygen-rich, is studied by in situ scanning transmission
                 electron microscopy (STEM). An automated pathway to

                 show a clear difference in the temperature at which phase
                 transition occurs and the domain behavior between various
                 environments, with a peculiar domain reconfiguration at low
                 temperatures, from a-c to a-a at $\approx$60 °C. The vacuum
                 environment exhibits a rich domain structure, while under the
                 oxidizing environment, the domain structure is largely
                 suppressed. The direct visualization provided by in situ gas
                 and heating STEM allows to investigate the influence of
                 external variables such as gas, pressure, and temperature, on

                   analysis at the nanoscale. In electronic and quantum
                   materials, this new capability gives access to, for example,
                   emergent chiral structures and symmetry-breaking distortions
                   that underpin functional properties. Quantifying nanoscale
                   structural features with statistical significance, however,
                   is complicated by the subtleties of dynamic diffraction and
                   coexisting contrast mechanisms, which often results in low
                   signal-to-noise and the superposition of multiple signals

                 It is challenging to make ML models fail because statistical
                 correlations can mimic the physics without causality. Here,
                 using a benchmark band-excitation piezoresponse force
                 microscopy polarization spectroscopy (BEPS) dataset the
                 pitfalls of the so-called ``better'', ``faster'', and
                 ``less-biased'' ML of electromechanical switching are
                 demonstrated and overcome. Using a toy and real experimental
                 dataset, it is demonstrated how linear nontemporal ML methods
                 result in physically reasonable embedding (eigenvalues) while
                 producing nonsensical eigenvectors and generated spectra,
                 promoting misleading interpretations. A new method of
                 unsupervised multimodal hyperspectral analysis of BEPS is
                 demonstrated using long-short-term memory (LSTM)
                 $\beta$-variational autoencoders ($\beta$-VAEs) . By including
                 LSTM neurons, the ordinal nature of ferroelectric switching is
                 considered. To improve the interpretability of the latent
                 space, a variational Kullback-Leibler-divergency
                 regularization is imposed . Finally, regularization scheduling
                 of $\beta$ as a disentanglement metric is leveraged to reduce
                 user bias. Combining these experiment-inspired modifications
                 enables the automated detection of ferroelectric switching
                 mechanisms, including a complex two-step, three-state one.
                 Ultimately, this work provides a robust ML method for the
                 rapid discovery of electromechanical switching mechanisms in
                 ferroelectrics and is applicable to other multimodal

  abstract    = {Ferroelectrics are being increasingly called upon for
                 electronic devices in extreme environments. Device performance
                 and energy efficiency is highly correlated to clock frequency,
                 operational voltage, and resistive loss. To increase
                 performance it is common to engineer ferroelectric domain
                 structure with highly-correlated electrical and elastic
                 coupling that elicit fast and efficient collective switching.
                 Designing domain structures with advantageous properties is
                 difficult because the mechanisms involved in collective
                 switching are poorly understood and difficult to investigate.
                 Collective switching is a hierarchical process where the nano-
                 and mesoscale responses control the macroscopic properties.
                 Using chemical solution synthesis, epitaxially nearly-relaxed
                 (100) BaTiO3 films are synthesized. Thermal strain induces a
                 strongly-correlated domain structure with alternating domains
                 of polarization along the [010] and [001] in-plane axes and
                 90° domain walls along the [011] or [01 1 \textasciimacron{}
                 $\bar\{1\}$ ] directions. Simultaneous capacitance-voltage
                 measurements and band-excitation piezoresponse force
                 microscopy revealed strong collective switching behavior.
                 Using a deep convolutional autoencoder, hierarchical switching
                 is automatically tracked and the switching pathway is
                 identified. The collective switching velocities are calculated
                 to be $\approx$500 cm s-1 at 5 V (7 kV cm-1 ),
                 orders-of-magnitude faster than expected. These combinations
                 of properties are promising for high-speed tunable dielectrics
                 and low-voltage ferroelectric memories and logic.},

  abstract    = {Abstract Ferroelectric materials exhibit spontaneous
                 polarization that can be switched by electric field. Beyond
                 traditional applications as nonvolatile capacitive elements,
                 the interplay between polarization and electronic transport in
                 ferroelectric thin films has enabled a path to neuromorphic
                 device applications involving resistive switching. A
                 fundamental challenge, however, is that finite electronic
                 conductivity may introduce considerable power dissipation and
                 perhaps destabilize ferroelectricity itself. Here, tunable
                 microwave frequency electronic response of domain walls
                 injected into ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate
                 (PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3) on the level of a single nanodomain is
                 revealed. Tunable microwave response is detected through
                 first-order reversal curve spectroscopy combined with scanning
                 microwave impedance microscopy measurements taken near 3 GHz.
                 Contributions of film interfaces to the measured AC conduction
                 through subtractive milling, where the film exhibited improved
                 conduction properties after removal of surface layers, are
                 investigated. Using statistical analysis and finite element
                 modeling, we inferred that the mechanism of tunable microwave
                 conductance is the variable area of the domain wall in the
                 switching volume. These observations open the possibilities
                 for ferroelectric memristors or volatile resistive switches,
                 localized to several tens of nanometers and operating
                 according to well-defined dynamics under an applied field.},

  abstract      = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are broadly
                   applied in engineering and physics. A standard description
                   of fluid dynamics requires solving the Navier-Stokes (N-S)
                   equations in different flow regimes. However, applications
                   of CFD simulations are computationally-limited by the
                   availability, speed, and parallelism of high-performance
                   computing. To improve computational efficiency, machine
                   learning techniques have been used to create accelerated
                   data-driven approximations for CFD. A majority of such
                   approaches rely on large labeled CFD datasets that are
                   expensive to obtain at the scale necessary to build robust
                   data-driven models. We develop a weakly-supervised approach
                   to solve the steady-state N-S equations under various
                   boundary conditions, using a multi-channel input with
                   boundary and geometric conditions. We achieve
                   state-of-the-art results without any labeled simulation
                   data, but using a custom data-driven and physics-informed
                   loss function by using and small-scale solutions to prime
                   the model to solve the N-S equations. To improve the
                   resolution and predictability, we train stacked models of
                   increasing complexity generating the numerical solutions for
                   N-S equations. Without expensive computations, our model
                   achieves high predictability with a variety of obstacles and
                   boundary conditions. Given its high flexibility, the model
                   can generate a solution on a 64 x 64 domain within 5 ms on a
                   regular desktop computer which is 1000 times faster than a
                   regular CFD solver. Translation of interactive CFD
                   simulation on local consumer computing hardware enables new
                   applications in real-time predictions on the internet of
                   things devices where data transfer is prohibitive and can
                   increase the scale, speed, and computational cost of
                   boundary-value fluid problems.},

                unstructured structural and functional images are acquired;
                however, only an infinitesimally small fraction of this data is
                rigorously analyzed, with an even smaller fraction ever being
                published. One method to accelerate scientific discovery is to
                extract more insight from costly scientific experiments already
                conducted. Unfortunately, data from scientific experiments tend
                only to be accessible by the originator who knows the
                experiments and directives. Moreover, there are no robust
                methods to search unstructured databases of images to deduce
                correlations and insight. Here, we develop a machine learning
                approach to create image similarity projections to search
                unstructured image databases. To improve these projections, we
                develop and train a model to include symmetry-aware features. As
                an exemplar, we use a set of 25,133 piezoresponse force
                microscopy images collected on diverse materials systems over
                five years. We demonstrate how this tool can be used for
                interactive recursive image searching and exploration,
                highlighting structural similarities at various length scales.
                This tool justifies continued investment in federated scientific
                databases with standardized metadata schemas where the

                 interfaces in disordered media. The distribution of nanoscale
                 switching event sizes is studied in two
                 Pb(Zr\_\{0.2\}Ti\_\{0.8\})O\_\{3\} thin films with different
                 disorder landscapes using piezoresponse force microscopy.
                 While the switching event statistics show the expected
                 power-law scaling, significant variations in the value of the
                 scaling exponent $\tau$ are seen, possibly as a consequence of
                 the different intrinsic disorder landscapes in the samples and
                 of further alterations under high tip bias applied during
                 domain writing. Importantly, higher exponent values
                 (1.98-2.87) are observed when crackling statistics are

  abstract    = {Multiscale and multimodal imaging of material structures and
                 properties provides solid ground on which materials theory and
                 design can flourish. Recently, KAIST announced 10 flagship
                 research fields, which include KAIST Materials Revolution:
                 Materials and Molecular Modeling, Imaging, Informatics and
                 Integration (M3I3). The M3I3 initiative aims to reduce the
                 time for the discovery, design and development of materials
                 based on elucidating multiscale processing-structure-property
                 relationship and materials hierarchy, which are to be
                 quantified and understood through a combination of machine
                 learning and scientific insights. In this review, we begin by
                 introducing recent progress on related initiatives around the
                 globe, such as the Materials Genome Initiative (U.S.),
                 Materials Informatics (U.S.), the Materials Project (U.S.),
                 the Open Quantum Materials Database (U.S.), Materials Research
                 by Information Integration Initiative (Japan), Novel Materials
                 Discovery (E.U.), the NOMAD repository (E.U.), Materials
                 Scientific Data Sharing Network (China), Vom Materials Zur
                 Innovation (Germany), and Creative Materials Discovery
                 (Korea), and discuss the role of multiscale materials and
                 molecular imaging combined with machine learning in realizing
                 the vision of M3I3. Specifically, microscopies using photons,
                 electrons, and physical probes will be revisited with a focus
                 on the multiscale structural hierarchy, as well as
                 structure-property relationships. Additionally, data mining
                 from the literature combined with machine learning will be
                 shown to be more efficient in finding the future direction of
                 materials structures with improved properties than the
                 classical approach. Examples of materials for applications in
                 energy and information will be reviewed and discussed. A case
                 study on the development of a Ni-Co-Mn cathode materials
                 illustrates M3I3's approach to creating libraries of
                 multiscale structure-property-processing relationships. We end
                 with a future outlook toward recent developments in the field
                 of M3I3.},

  abstract  = {Ferroelectric domain walls are promising quasi-2D structures
               that can be leveraged for miniaturization of electronics
               components and new mechanisms to control electronic signals at
               the nanoscale. Despite the significant progress in experiment
               and theory, however, most investigations on ferroelectric domain
               walls are still on a fundamental level, and reliable
               characterization of emergent transport phenomena remains a
               challenging task. Here, we apply a neural-network-based approach
               to regularize local I(V)-spectroscopy measurements and improve
               the information extraction, using data recorded at charged
               domain walls in hexagonal (Er0.99,Zr0.01)MnO3 as an instructive
               example. Using a sparse long short-term memory autoencoder, we
               disentangle competing conductivity signals both spatially and as
               a function of voltage, facilitating a less biased, unconstrained
               and more accurate analysis compared to a standard evaluation of
               conductance maps. The neural-network-based analysis allows us to
               isolate extrinsic signals that relate to the tip-sample contact
               and separating them from the intrinsic transport behavior
               associated with the ferroelectric domain walls in
               (Er0.99,Zr0.01)MnO3. Our work expands machine-learning-assisted
               scanning probe microscopy studies into the realm of local
               conductance measurements, improving the extraction of physical
               conduction mechanisms and separation of interfering current
               signals.},

                 explore the jerky, highly nonlinear dynamics of elastic
                 interfaces in disordered media. The distribution of nanoscale
                 switching event sizes is studied in two
                 Pb(Zr\_\{0.2\}Ti\_\{0.8\})O\_\{3\} thin films with different
                 disorder landscapes using piezoresponse force microscopy.
                 While the switching event statistics show the expected
                 power-law scaling, significant variations in the value of the
                 scaling exponent $\tau$ are seen, possibly as a consequence of
                 the different intrinsic disorder landscapes in the samples and
                 of further alterations under high tip bias applied during
                 domain writing. Importantly, higher exponent values
                 (1.98-2.87) are observed when crackling statistics are
                 acquired only for events occurring in the creep regime. The
                 exponents are systematically lowered when all events across
                 both creep and depinning regimes are considered-the first time
                 such a distinction is made in studies of ferroelectric
                 materials. These results show that distinguishing the two
                 regimes is of crucial importance, significantly affecting the
                 exponent value and potentially leading to incorrect assignment
                 of universality class.},

  abstract    = {The ability to manipulate domains underpins function in
                 applications of ferroelectrics. While there have been
                 demonstrations of controlled nanoscale manipulation of domain
                 structures to drive emergent properties, such approaches lack
                 an internal feedback loop required for automatic manipulation.
                 Here, using a deep sequence-to-sequence autoencoder we
                 automate the extraction of latent features of nanoscale

                 of tensile-strained PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 with a hierarchical domain
